        <h2> Petals by Yara story </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Petals by Yara</strong> began as a dream, starting from nothing but a deep love for flowers and the joy they bring <br>
            Founded in 2024, our mission has always been to provide the freshest, most elegant floral arrangements to suit any occasion.
        </p>
        <p>My passion for nature and the beauty of each flower inspired me to create something that would reflect that love. From the very beginning, I wanted to offer more than just pretty bouquets—I wanted to ensure that each flower was treated with care and attention. 
            <br> <strong>Petals by Yara</strong> has grown into a trusted brand known for quality and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, flowers are not just decoration; they’re living things that deserve to be handled with love and precision. Every arrangement is carefully crafted, paying attention to even the smallest details, because I believe that’s where the magic lies
        </p>
             <p>
<b>Petals by Yara</b> is my way of sharing my passion for flowers and the beauty they bring to our lives, one petal at a time.
</p>
        <p>
